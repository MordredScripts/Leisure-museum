        <h2 class="ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</h2>
        <p>Greetings from the land where illusion and reality coexist! The Illusions Museum The first of its 
           type in South Africa, Johannesburg is an intriguing new addition to the nation's recreational and
           cultural scene. This museum, which opened in July 2024 at The Zone @ Rosebank, is more than just a
           collection of displays; it's an experience meant to enthrall, inform, and enigmatize guests of all ages.

        <h2 class="what_is">WHAT IS A LEISURE MUSEUM.</h2>
        <p>The typical idea of a museum is redefined by leisure museums. Leisure museums prioritize providing visitors 
            with immersive, interactive, and captivating experiences rather than preserving static items and following 
            a strictly instructional narrative.
        </p>

        <h2 class="history">THE HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM</h2>
        <p>  An international network of interactive museums called the Museum of Illusions welcomes guests into the 
          fascinating realm of sensory sensations and optical illusions in interactive museums. The museum was 
          established in Zagreb, Croatia, in 2015 and has since spread to more than 30 locations across the globe, 
          enthralling visitors with its distinctive fusion of entertainment and knowledge. Exhibits at each place test
          your senses, alter your perception, and cause you to doubt reality. The same fascinating experience can be 
          had in Johannesburg at the Museum of Illusions, which opened its doors in July of this year. This museum, 
          which is housed in The Zone Rosebank Mall, uses a variety of immersive displays and mind-bending installations
          to bring the world of illusions to life.

        <h2 class="highlights">HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MUSEUM</h2>
        <p> The Museum of Illusions Johannesburg features more than 60 displays that are meant to both amuse and educate
          visitors. Every exhibit is a fun mental challenge that shows how easy visual and sensory signals may fool our
          minds. You can think of it (at least partially) as a house of mirrors with the science still in place, 
          explaining in an easy-to-understand manner why your eyes and brain are being tricked. This has a lot of 
          potential for school trips and families who want their outings to be more intellectual but still enjoyable 
          and sensual. In the future, you'll probably see a ton of pictures from the Museum of Illusions Johannesburg. 
          Although food and beverages are prohibited within the museum, the customary "don't touch; "No photos" is not 
          an option. Staff members are even available to assist you with taking photos with your phone at some of the major 
          installations.
